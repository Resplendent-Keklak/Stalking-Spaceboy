<title>Instructions on How to Use Stalking Spaceboy</title>
<p>While I normally do have a vast set of instructions when it comes to the code of my repositories, with this one I'll be lenient. Not everyone likes it when they see nested folders of markdown files and end up getting bossed around by a random "Instructions.md" blaring white-against-black (or black-against-white, if you're that pea brained) in front of their eyes, and I understand that.</p>

<p><strong>That's why I'm providing you the freedom to do <emph>almost</emph> whatever you want with this repository.</strong></p>

<p>I bet you clicked on this sorry little file hoping to see a meth addict's scrawl uploaded as a <emph>*gasp*</emph> WEBP file and added to the markdown alone like an absolute lunatic would do. Well, too bad, I don't do drugs :)</p>

<h1>GET TO THE POINT</h1>
<p>Anyway, back on topic. As long as you don't use this repository or its contents in a way that harms real-world people, go right ahead!</p>
