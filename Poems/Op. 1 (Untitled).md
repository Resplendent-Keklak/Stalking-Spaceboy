# Op. 1 (Untitled)
winteR rains always bring me to spaceboy,<br>
yet i've never experienced it while i cared aboUt him.<br>
it's been under a year Since i felt feelingS<br>
sImilAr to euphoria wheN it comes to fellow men,<br>
and i only began to RegOgnize those feelings<br>
as sparks of limerence jUst weeks into those depressing thoughts.<br>
i was aware from the start that it was spaceboy i LovEd<br>
and loved exclusively buT i had no chance To tEll him.

as I Sit on my porcH drenched in sheer mOisture<br>
i relish in the Wetness that calls me back to the prImordial ooze<br>
from where all GOdfOresaken humans originate.<br>
i wish for nothing more than to return to that blessed ignorant state<br>
so that i may no longer sUffer The agony of unrequited teenage affection.<br>
if ***you*** can, help me cease to be in pain.

**Author's Note: I am okay; this is just a writing exercise to channel my inner edgy kid**
