# Stalking-Spaceboy
***Stalking Spaceboy*** is a list of free copypasta made from poems annotated in markdown files (and no, you guys, this is not my capstone). Most of them have to do with a certain *hypothetical* individual we'll call Spaceboy. It's not a very special repository, but it does contain lots of filler text.
## Lore
HAHA NO! I'm not spoiling the lore of Spaceboy for you! What am I, a *spoiler*? NO!

If you'd like to get to know Spaceboy, you'll have to read through the files to piece together, well, whether or not you like Spaceboy. I like Spaceboy. Spaceboy is cool. More than cool, even.
## Usage
Use this repository *constructively*. How you're intended to use it could be anything from filler text in a school assignment, motivational poetry for your bedroom wall, whatever. As long as it doesn't hinge on harassment or inappropriate use of Github repositories, go right ahead and do what you will. 

If you know who Spaceboy is after reading Stalking Spaceboy, though, don't use this repository or the information you gained from it to go on a witch hunt. But, of course, Spaceboy isn't *real*, is he? He's a fictional character of my design. Only you can decide, though (\*mischievious laughter coming from behind you\*).
